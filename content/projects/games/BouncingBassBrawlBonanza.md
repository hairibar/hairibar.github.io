BBBB was a massive learning project for me. It was, at the time, the biggest thing I'd ever made, taking an entire year from the idea to the final release.
I made basically everything in it (except for a few character sprites): Programming, design, animation, music, sound, environment art...

### Here's the idea:
Multiple local players fight each other in two teams, trying to push their enemies off the stage. 
You can only do three things:
1. Jump
2. Punch
3. Say hi

So what's the catch? All the fish are **identical**, and their short terms memory means that you only see who belongs to what team briefly.
